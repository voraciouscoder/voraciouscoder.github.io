I want it because I’ve done so this year and discovered so much. I want others to do the same!</p>\n<p><strong>Circe</strong><br>\n<em>Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book published in 2018</em></p>\n<p>A banquet of Greek mythology woven around the goddess Circe, this book tackles some of the toughest struggles of being a woman and human, from motherhood to rape to mortality. I think this starts a personal trend of <em>listening</em> to mythology books.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed this book, though it was a little too long for me. It was fun to see gods from a different, less fun-loving perspective. I learned of a few other myths I’d never heard of before, despite a period of voraciously reading Greek myths in Grade 6. [SPOILER: Did anyone else get the <em>Tuck Everlasting</em> feels at the end?]</p>\n<p>I felt a dark vibe from this story similar to <em>Norse Mythology</em>, but I wasn’t expecting it from Greek mythology! Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more had I not been reading the even heavier <em>Bad Feminist</em> concurrently. One can only absorb so much weight at a time &#x3C;/3</p>\n<p>So now I’m off to go read something funny!</p>\n<p><strong>The Lover’s Dictionary</strong><br>\n<em>Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book you borrowed or was given to you as a gift</em></p>\n<p>I found my lighter read in this precious book &#x3C;3 It features a word per page with a description that captures a slice of love - happy or otherwise.</p>\n<p>The descriptions range from one sentence to a full paragraph - a testament to how much one word can inspire. I enjoyed this so much because of its parallels to improv. Often it’s just one word that sparks a <em>whole</em> scene!</p>\n<p>I’m glad I picked this up on a whim - I’ve been sticking religiously to books that fit my reading challenges (though this one fit a challenge anyway).</p>\n<p><strong>Daring to Drive</strong>  </p>\n<p>This is the third piece of literature/art I’ve experienced from Saudi Arabia. The first was the movie <em>Wadjda</em>, the first movie filmed entirely in Saudi (and directed by a woman!) which I recommend wholeheartedly. The other was <em>Girls of Riyadh</em>, by Rajaa al-Sanea, which gave another insider peek into Saudi culture.</p>\n<p>I found all of these pieces difficult to read/watch (but also fascinating) because of all the obstacles Saudi women face in their day-to-day lives, and the extreme inequality between genders. This was especially true for <em>Daring to Drive</em>.</p>\n<p>Women driving is no big deal right? That’s until you understand the context, which is what most of this book was. It was a dive into the culture that forbids women in so many ways.</p>\n<p>One of the hardest chapters for me was the one on female circumcision (or more accurately, genital mutilation). It comes early in the book, and it surprised me because I still thought this book was about driving. No details are spared.</p>\n<p>I loved that al-Sharif studied Computer Science like me! It was fun to read the details she shared about her work. She’s a CS role model I’d love to share to all my fellow women in tech. </p>\n<p>All-in-all reading this book made me feel immensely grateful for where I was born and now live. &#x3C;3</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 28",date:"September 16, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/reading-roundup-28/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/reading-roundup-27/"},frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 27"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/reading-roundup-29/"},frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 29"}}}}}});
