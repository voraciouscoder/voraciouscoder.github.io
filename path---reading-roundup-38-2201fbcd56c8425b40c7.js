It felt like a pop culture dude book, which is great for that target audience. Just like cheesy chick lit is great for me (sometimes! A girl can only read so much cheesiness).</p>\n<p>I got through it in two days though, so it was pretty engaging and the stuff I did get was nice (yay for text adventures!). Iâ€™m not super pleased with the token diverse person but it underlined how shitty the future in this book is, where it still sucks to be gay or black or a woman or all three!</p>\n<p>Oh, and I was getting major Manic Pixie Dream Girl vibes from the portrayal of the main girl character ðŸ™„ Câ€™mon.</p>\n<p>Anyway, at least Iâ€™m caught up with this piece of pop culture!
