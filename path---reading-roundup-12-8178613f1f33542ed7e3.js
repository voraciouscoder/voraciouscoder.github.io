Also I bumped into <a href="https://twitter.com/lethal_heroine">Heather O‚ÄôNeill</a> and I felt inspired to write more.\nSo here I am, back to writing about my week‚Äôs reads.</p>\n<p><a href="http://jessieannfoley.com/?page_id=47"><strong>The Carnival at Bray</strong></a><br>\n<em>Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book set in the decade you were born</em></p>\n<p>This was a fun read! It probably would have been one of my favourites if it had been released when I was in high school.\nI‚Äôm a sucker for first love stories. Also I‚Äôve been meaning to plan a trip to Ireland, and this book only fuels this wish even more.\nThe only question I‚Äôm left with now is how to pronounce Eoin. Oh Irish names &#x3C;3</p>\n<p><em>Update: Apparently Eoin is like Owen üòç</em></p>\n<p><a href="http://heathbrothers.com/books/decisive/"><strong>Decisive: How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work</strong></a><br>\n<em>Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book by two authors</em></p>\n<p>This book was highly touted at work (and there were free copies to take), so I gave it a read.\nThere were plenty of actionable ideas in it, and quite applicable given that we all have thousands of decisions to make every day.\nAs someone who can get overwhelmed with the packed nature of non-fiction, I appreciated the chapter summaries.\nNot the most enjoyable read of the week, but definitely useful and recommendable!</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.simongarfield.com/pages/books/just_my_type.htm"><strong>Just My Type: A Book About Fonts</strong></a><br>\n<em>Popsugar Reading Challenge: A microhistory</em></p>\n<p>If I thought I was picky about fonts before‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs much worse now. I loved this mish-mash of stories about type.\nIt put real humans behind the letters everyone sees! I was reminded of researching the mathematicians behind different formulas.\n(Or maybe of a different microhistory I‚Äôve read.) This book introduced me to the <em>world</em> of type. It‚Äôs huge!\nThankfully we‚Äôre in the age of the Internet where I can simply search them online, not laboriously in doorstopper book.\nI learned about the hate for Comic Sans and Arial, but also the love for Helvetica, and just how old some types are.\nIt even helped me choose the fonts for this new site (I ditched one because of its long commas).\nSo if you want to have a taste of the passion behind the shapes of letters, please read this book :)</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 12",date:"May 27, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/reading-roundup-12/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/hello-world/"},frontmatter:{title:"Hello World!"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/reading-roundup-13/"},frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 13"}}}}}});
