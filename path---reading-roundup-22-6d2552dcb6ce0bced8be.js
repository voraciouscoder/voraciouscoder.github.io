(A never-ending shelf makes me feel guilty if I never choose the books on it.) So I decided to do a re-read!</p>\n<p>This is one of the books in my 2012 span of using Goodreads (there’s a gap between 2012 &#x26; 2015, which was me being a busy university student). I remember reading it earlier than that because it a was a shared favourite between me and one of my oldest bookworm buddies. We used to say “Owen!” and sigh.</p>\n<p>Anyway! This book is about magic in New York City and how one Midwestern girl finds out about it due to her immunity to magical spells. <em>Enchanted, Inc.</em> is the first book of her adventures with it, and there’s a cute and powerful wizard in it called Owen (hehe). It’s short and sweet and reminded me of many shared book moments with an old friend &#x3C;3</p>\n<p><strong>Sag Harbor</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Sand Between My Toes</em></p>\n<p>This month’s challenge categories featured a lot of beachiness, but I didn’t want all fluffy reads. So I discovered <em>Sag Harbor</em>, a book about “black boys with beach houses” in the mid-80s. It was an eye-opening read for me.</p>\n<p>I never considered that people of colour were barred from owning a place in the Hamptons, but given history, it makes sense. So it was fun to dive into the culture, with the rap rhymes, the summer jobs, and the freedom of parents being in the city. All with the backdrop of being black of a certain privilege, including going to fancy private schools, but being the only black boys there.</p>\n<p>When I was younger, I enjoyed books from the point of boys, reading everything from <em>Captain Underpants</em>, <em>The Day My Butt Went Psycho</em>, to the <em>Swim the Fly</em> series by Don Calame. It was fun to see things from another perspective, and reading <em>Sag Harbor</em> reminded me of this joy.</p>\n<p><strong>Mãn</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: One and Done</em></p>\n<p>One of the benefits of reading fast is that what counts as a one-sitting read can be pretty long. <em>Mãn</em> surprised me though! I chose it because it is a slim book, but it is full of depth and almost reads like free verse poetry. And one does not simply speed read poetry.</p>\n<p>You taste the words, and savour them, and <em>feel</em> them. Which is perfect for this book, a tale that intertwines culture, immigration, and food. This is my second read by this author, and I loved this one even more than <em>Ru</em> because of the descriptions of food. I love local authors!!!</p>\n<p>Good thing I’m done my reviews for this week and can go eat some pho or banh mi now.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 22",date:"August 07, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/reading-roundup-22/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/reading-roundup-21/"},frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 21"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/reading-roundup-23/"},frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 23"}}}}}});
