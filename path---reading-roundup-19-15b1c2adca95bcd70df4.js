I blame it on the ridiculously hot weather that makes me want to stay still.</p>\n<p><strong>Seating Arrangements</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Backyard BBQ</em></p>\n<p>This book read as painfully elitist. Perhaps that was the point of it? There were many POV changes that opened different storylines and by the end, I felt like not all of them were tied off. Or maybe I was disappointed that the one character I identified with (the non-white, not rich one) didn’t have a neat end to her story. Anyway! This book put me off WASPy stories so much that I started <em>The Vacationers</em> by Emma Straub and I couldn’t get past the first few pages.</p>\n<p><strong>The Red-Haired Woman</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Red, White, and Blue</em></p>\n<p>I promise that I chose this book before I saw my dad’s collection of Orhan Pamuk books! Then again, I chose it because it had the word “Red” in the title. It doesn’t matter because this book was such a breath of fresh air after the cloying, WASPy <em>Seating Arrangements</em>.</p>\n<p>I was enchanted by the new-to-me location (Turkey), the Eastern vibes, and I just flew through the story. That’s the magic of Nobel Prize winners right? It actually reminded me of <em>The Bad Girl</em> by Mario Vargas Llosa for the way it followed one man’s life, and the threads of obsession throughout the story.</p>\n<p>Time to sneak in some more Orhan Pamuk into my reading challenges!</p>\n<p><strong>Fangirls</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Embrace Your Inner Geek</em></p>\n<p>The best part of this book was the way it encourages and validates the fangirl experience. I also appreciated the way it addresses the toxic behaviours that can be in the community. While things are slowly getting better, I think it’s important to be ready for the shitty stuff.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I was confused at the target age group for this book. The tone sounded middle/high school but one section mentioned grabbing beers to make friends. It’s a great resource if you want a self-contained intro, but so much of it can be found online. Then again, I’m probably biased by my geeky computer background.</p>\n<p><strong>Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Funny Bone</em></p>\n<p>I love Mindy Kaling! It’s gratifying to read a famous funny woman of colour. This was a fun collection of essays on different things. I appreciate the random list-making! Also I’m <em>so</em> glad her wish of Ocean’s 8 became a real thing. Go seeeeeee it, just for the badass women in it.</p>\n<p><strong>In the Bag</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Beach Bum</em></p>\n<p>When I was in middle school, I read all the Kate Klise books I could, and my favourite one was the very summery <em>Letters From Camp</em>. Kate Klise and her illustrator sister took the epistolary style to the next level, using notes, new headlines, maps, and other written ephemera to tell these stories. I was fascinated!</p>\n<p><em>In the Bag</em> is one of Klise’s adult novels, and still, letters (emails) were featured! It was a fun one-sitting read that had me girly-squealing from the unrealistic but too cute storyline. In other words, a perfect beach read.</p>\n<p><strong>13 Ways to Look at a Fat Girl</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Colours of Summer</em></p>\n<p>Okay, so the cover is arguably green, but I hey, I wanted to read this Canadian author (especially since she was born in my city &#x3C;3).</p>\n<p>I seem to be on a roll with books that feature unhealthy obsession. This one was particularly sad to me, maybe because I know obsession with body fat/weight is so prevalent in our society and disproportionately affects women.</p>\n<p>The book dives into different times in main character’s life, so you get a thorough view on the many ways being fat, and maybe more importantly, feeling fat impacts her life. It made me equal parts sad and mad at society, and what better compliment to a book can you give than “it made me feel things”!?</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 19",date:"July 17, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/reading-roundup-19/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/reading-roundup-18/"},frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 18"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/reading-roundup-20/"},frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 20"}}}}}});
