If I’m being honest to myself though, I was probably still going to read more than that, hehe.</p>\n<p><strong>Binti: Home</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Sun, Moon, and Stars</em></p>\n<p>Yes! I identified so much with Binti in this story, who is unique in so many of the roles she takes on. I never would have guessed that I would find this in a sci-fi book set in space. Then again, this series is unique. Even Ursula K. Le Guin said “There’s more vivid imagination in a page of Nnedi Okorafor’s work than in whole volumes of ordinary fantasy epics.” So go read this one while I wait for my hold on the third one to become available! </p>\n<p><strong>Binti: Night Masquerade</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: The Future is Always Bright</em></p>\n<p>So I ended up getting this book a few days later! The final book in the series, and I’m glad I was able to choose this book for this challenge because it mentioned the future setting in <em>Home</em>.</p>\n<p>Sadly, this Binti book wasn’t my favourite, because there were just so many loose ends to tie together. That distinction goes to <em>Home</em>. I wish there were more Binti books, instead of this messy, unsatisfying conclusion. Ah well, I can only hope to read more Nnedi Okafor in the future. ;)</p>\n<p><strong>Naked Alliances</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: I Feel a Breeze</em></p>\n<p>This was a fun romp of a book! I must admit that I wasn’t sure I’d like it because I tend to pick things that lots of people have (generally good) opinions on. For this challenge though, there weren’t many options. And if I’ve learned something about me as a reader this year, it’s that I like fun mysteries. (Though I really shouldn’t be surprised about this given my reading choices of Encyclopedia Brown and Nancy Drew as a little girl).</p>\n<p><em>Naked Alliances</em> did require a certain amount of open-mindedness for its content, but I don’t think it would shock many people in my circles (mostly millennials in Montreal?), and the serious subjects felt more background to the action. It reminds me of reading <em>Peyton Place</em> (a book that was banned in Canada), and feeling underwhelmed, then grateful that society has opened up about once taboo subjects.</p>\n<p><strong>Paletas</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Get Your Grill On</em></p>\n<p>I chose this book because my original selection got renewed at the library and won’t make to me in time for this month. I’m glad it worked out though! I learned about a cool (pun intended, since paletas are ice pops) slice of Mexican cuisine that only makes me want to visit it even more. Also I like things that confirm that avocado can be dessert food (not just guac people!)</p>\n<p><strong>Beauty Tips from Moose Jaw</strong>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Forefathers</em></p>\n<p>This book was a recommendation from my parents, who helped me visit almost all the provinces (but no territories!) in Canada. Thank you Mom &#x26; Dad!</p>\n<p>While it’s not directly about the founding fathers (my, how patriarchal), it does dive into several of the outposts that made Canada what it is today. And that my friends, is a lot more exciting than any of the books I found about our founding fathers.</p>\n<p>This book makes me want to finally make a trip to Newfoundland, and do more road trips around the beautiful province I live in, and generally celebrate being Canadian &#x3C;3 Oh, and it will probably make you laugh too :D</p>\n<p><strong>The Wedding Date</strong><br>\n<em>Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Diversify Yourself</em></p>\n<p>Oh what a feel-good story! This is my kind of chick lit! Y’know the one where the woman of colour gets the guy? To be real though, how many chick flicks feature a woman of colour? There has to be better representation. Thankfully I can read books like this in the meantime.</p>\n<p>I loved the little details in this book that spoke to what it’s like to date a white guy as a woman of colour. “Am I going to be the only black person there?” <em>So</em> relateable. It even covered the trials of long distance relationships and communicating through emotionless texts. So yes, this was the perfect cheesy read for me. </p>\n<p>And please, as if I haven’t already read authors of colour (at least twenty, okay?). I’ll admit it does take effort though, but it’s well worth it.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 20",date:"July 22, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/reading-roundup-20/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/reading-roundup-19/"},frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 19"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/reading-roundup-21/"},frontmatter:{title:"Reading Roundup 21"}}}}}});
