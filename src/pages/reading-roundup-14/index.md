Fact: when you read six books in a week, there's less time for writing about them. This week I'll attempt to leave more time for writing!

**Attachments**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Dear Pen Pal_

One of my favourite books in elementary school was _Letters from Camp_ by Kate Klise, which was told through letters, notes, newspaper clippings, and other clippings. I was enchanted with the fact that you could tell an entire story with snippets of communication. So I was excited for this challenge.

_Attachments_ was told through a mix of emails (it's a kind of letter right!?), and a limited third-person point-of-view. It was cute but I spent a bit of time cringing at the stereotypical IT guy depiction. This book did _not_ age well with its mentions of Y2K. On the other hand it was fun to consider romance before the time of ubiquitous smartphones. Also it was Rainbow Rowell's first book, I can forgive her. Otherwise I'd skip this book unless you feel nostalgic for 90s communication?

**The Crossover**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Sports-a-holic_

I was not expecting a kids basketball book to be poetry-as-prose... so _The Crossover_ was a pleasant surprise! It reminded me of writing my own attempts at basketball-themed poetry in grade school. It's a small book but manages to delve into fathers, sibling rivalry, and some young angst. All in free verse mind you. I'm filing this under favourite basketball stories!

**Meanwhile**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Childhood Reboot_

Choose-your-own-adventure comic book! What more do I need to say? I read this book with bae and we both enjoyed it thoroughly. Give yourself a chunk of time to read it though, as the many storylines may frustrate you. Puzzle-lovers, put this on your TBR! (Yes, I know the challenge says _novel_ but trust me, this book requires more thinking than many novels.)

**Grief is the Thing with Feathers**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Father Knows Best_

This one brought on the feels. I purposely read about death (_From Here to Eternity_) instead of grief for the Popsugar Reading Challenge and yet here I am, reviewing a book about grief. Like _The Crossover_, this book used the lyrical quality of poetry-as-prose to tug on your heartstrings. I promise I didn't pick two poetry-as-prose books this week on purpose!

I didn't quite get the role of the crow in the book, probably because the main character is a Ted Hughes scholar and I have not read any Ted Hughes. (I did force myself through _Ariel_ by Sylvia Plath earlier this year.) I admire crows because they are wonderfully smart birds, but given the crow's role in sadness in this book, I'm not tempted to read any Ted Hughes right now.

On the other hand, the contrast of the young boys' grief compared to the father's grief made the father's grief that much stronger for me. And to think, I haven't yet experienced this level of grief before. This will be on my list to read or suggest when that inevitable grief strikes.

A note on the challenge category: Where are all the good dads in literature!?

**Rubyfruit Jungle**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Take Pride_

This book made me think of _Peyton Place_, which was banned in Canada at some point, because it was considered to be too scandalous. I can imagine Rubyfruit Jungle was considered scandalous at its publication due to its depiction of lesbian relationships. I'm sure the fact that title turned out to be the description of female gentalia made it even more offensive to some people, hehe.

This was my second read that centered around women loving women (the other being _Landing_ by Emma Donoghue, which I loved!), but it wasn't only about that. I appreciated that Molly stayed true to herself throughout the book, whether it was about going to university or film school in New York. The sexism she experienced from getting into a predominantly (completely) men's field reminded me of parts of tech industry I'm in today.

Before doing book challenges I used to want to pick books out "on my own", like a hipster. Now I'm glad to have book challenges push me and give me an opportunity to read classics or seminal works like _Rubyfruit Jungle_.

**99 Bottles of OOP**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book with song lyrics in the title_

I filled this challenge by accident, as this book was required reading for a workshop I got to do through work. It was so perfectly apt though, as the examples in the book centered around the lyrics of _99 Bottles_. Turns out you can learn a lot of from one song :)

Phew! That was an intense week of reading. And I passed 50 books read this year!
