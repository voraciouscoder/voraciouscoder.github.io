It's Novembrrrr, I finally gave in and have been wearing my thick jackets. That and the time change has been making me feel like cocooning (to read of course).

**The Black Tides of Heaven**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book with characters who are twins_

OOH! A world that uses gender neutral pronouns until the character has chosen their gender. It was cool to see this used in a book. I imagined it might be clunkier than it was in this novel. I'm all-in on singular they <3

I'm glad I found this book (via the category links in my library catalogue system) for the twins category. I tried reading _The God of Small Things_ but I don't think I was ready for a family saga with plenty of difficult subjects and long flashbacks. Too heavy for me right now.

_The Black Tides of Heaven_ was quick to read but packed with a cool fantasy world with lots of far east influence. One excellent reason to read diversely (and pick series so you can experience in the world for more than a book hehe).

**Hallowe'en Party**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book about or set on Halloween_

Agatha Christie is always fun to come back to, and so are books that are in season. Although not summer books in summer, those make me feel like I should be doing _more_ with my summer.

This one reminded me of _Still Life_, with the small-town setting in October, with the big city detective coming in to solve the crime, but with less anticipation of the books to come. After all, this is Poirot past his prime, and the beginning of Armand Gamache.

Is this Agatha's best work? Nah. Did I enjoy it? Yes! Now I want to re-read _The Murder of Roger Ackroyd_. Or continue Ovidia Yu's _Aunty Lee_ series. Or Mario Giordano's _Auntie Poldi_ series. If only my libraries had the rest of these series. Excuse me, I'll be researching how to do inter-library loans.
