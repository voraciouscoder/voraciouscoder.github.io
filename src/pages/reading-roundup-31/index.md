Happy Thanksgiving! üçÅ Hope my fellow Canadians got some reading in during the long weekend üìñ My reading choices this week were focused on ease and enjoyment. There are so many heartbreaking books out there, but I can always take a break from them with lighter books.

**Still Life**

_2017: The first book in a series you haven't read before_

I finally read a Louise Penny book! It was recommended by my mom and honestly, I should have read it earlier since it's (almost) a local read. On the other hand, the timing was perfect since the story is starts on Thanksgiving.

Local reads are fun because you recognize all the little details. In this case, it was the sprinkling of French, the Quebecker swears, and the places in Montr√©al. It made me want to go drive through the Eastern Townships - especially in the current foliage.

I feel like this isn't the best Penny book yet, but I'm glad I started at the beginning so I can experience the improvement. A very soft way to say that there were some things in the plot that didn't feel so smooth, but I still want to read more!

This is why I picked this challenge as my fave one - if you pick a good book, it's a gift that comes with more books.

**Akata Witch**

Thank you to my fellow voracious reader Chloe for this excellent suggestion! I was probably going to get to this eventually because I love Nnedi Okorafor but it got fast-tracked by recommendation.

Just like the Binti series, there's so much to _Akata Witch_ that feels so original. There's the girl witch thing, then you add her badass soccer skills, the focus on learning and teamwork and then I'm done a book in one sitting.

Good thing there's more! I have to pace myself on Okorafor books or I'll be sad that there aren't more out right now - just like I've been doing with Heather O'Neill books. <3

**Something in Between**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book tied to your ancestry_

I definitely have to be in a specific mood to read YA these days (otherwise I'll roll my eyes out of their sockets), but this one caught me at the right time.

To my bae, this story was a squealer (one that made me squeeeee in delight). It may have been cheesy and predictable but I adore immigrant stories and this one featured a Filipina!

There's nothing like seeing your culture represented in writing (when it normally isn't). I loved seeing the words lumpia, Ilocano, and anak. Can I have more please?
