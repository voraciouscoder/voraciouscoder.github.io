I'm in that "last stretch of a book challenge" frenzy (imagine the FINISH HIM! cry in Mortal Kombat ;) ). It's to the point where I have the same book on hold at two libraries ðŸ™Š And anxiously creeping on what people are reading on the subway (it's for a reading challenge, okay?). I'm almost there though!

**James and the Giant Peach**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book that is also a stage play or musical_

I struggled with this challenge because it was mostly classic novels on the lists I found. Not super appealing to me, so I chose the throw it back to a play I remember being in as a kid! I don't remember which character I was though ðŸ¤”

It's funny how many details I'd forgotten about the book - James' aunts, the seagulls, and the Gloworm. Definitely worth the re-read of one of my fave children's book authors. Maybe next up is Matilda!

**Chocolat**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book made into a movie that you've already seen_

Another tougher challenge for me, since I don't watch a lot of movies. I had to read a bunch of lists to find one that I felt like experiencing the story again (albeit in a different way).

Watching the movie first ruined this book for me. I kept looking for details from the movie! It mostly made me want to watch the movie again.

The book did have mouthwatering descriptions of food and desserts though. I also enjoyed the extra details on Armande the grandmother. Overall a fun read - but probably better if you read it first.

**The Bat**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: Nordic noir_

I hated the callous treatment of the love interest in this story. It just wasn't believable to me that someone would agree to be serial killer bait. He might as well have [put her in a refrigerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Refrigerators) ðŸ™„ Ugh.

Otherwise, if you're expecting a story set in Norway, this is not the one. There are a lot of twists and turns but it's all set in Australia. Similar to Louise Penny's debut _Still Life_, I can tell that this is Nesbo's best work but it's fun to see the beginning!

**Modern Romance**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A past Goodreads Choice Awards winner_

Meh. If you've already read Helen Fisher, Esther Perel, and Sheena Iyengar, this book isn't much of a revelation. The best parts were the anecdotes from the focus groups (that were part of the research of this book) and the insights into the culture of romance in Japan.

It _was_ interesting to read from a man's perspective, especially given that Ansari is wont to give examples from his own life. I've mostly read and listened to women on the subject, so this was new for me.

I think I'll go back to listening to mythologies though - it's more apt for storytelling out loud, and I'm not missing any graphs.
