I'm slowly making my through the _Circe_ audiobook, so I had to pair it with some non-fiction (or poetry - but poetry collections are also slow-going).

**Bad Feminist**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book about feminism_

I have so many FEELS about this book. The best part of it for me was the fresh perspective. Roxane Gay is an unapologetic voice for so many unrepresented people. 

The collection is personal and unabashed. It made me feel the humanities gap in my STEM education, in my writing and analysis. Good thing learning doesn't stop in school ;)
