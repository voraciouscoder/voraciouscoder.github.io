Only six books left in my Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge! When I started the summer I wasn't sure if I could (or even should) do it but now I'm so glad I did.

**The Wangs vs. the World**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Life is a Highway_

I forgot to write a review of this last week! Perhaps I'm reading too fast (but thank goodness for Goodreads to help me track things).

This was a fun romp around the US with an Asian-American family. It dealt with the 2008 financial crisis in a way that reminded me of the movie _The Big Short_ but had echoes of the privileges I read about in _Seating Arrangements_, which I read earlier this year.

I enjoyed the different perspectives of the family, and loved the portrayal of Asians as capable artists, which is a narrative that feels missing from the mainstream of our culture (and that makes me glad for K-pop).

So much love to all the Asian-heritage authors I've been reading lately, please keep telling stories.

**Boy Erased**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: The Book Is Always Better_

In general, if you ask if I've seen a movie, I probably haven't (ignore the previous review). I might have read the book though. This challenge called for a book turning into a movie this year. From [this list](https://www.bookbub.com/blog/2017/12/26/book-adaptations-2018-movies), I chose _Boy Erased_ (because I've already read _A Wrinkle in Time_, _Crazy Rich Asians_, _Monster_).

This book felt way too long for an experience that lasted little over a week. It started out interesting but there were so many flashbacks that it lost steam for me. I appreciated the raw feelings and honesty, but honestly, it felt like it would have been better at half the length.

I won't be watching the movie (though I normally wouldn't anyway).

**Rad Women Worldwide**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Girl Power_

I picked this book on a whim from the suggestions in Libby (the e-library app), and it was totally worth it! It's a shallow, accessible dive into the lives of badass women from around the world.

It was a great mix of adventurers, artists, scientists, and much more. Definitely recommend to all the girls as a starting point to learning more about great and diverse women in history.

The best part for me was learning about Fe Del Mundo, the first woman to attend Harvard Medical because they mistook her name to be a man's name. Hah! They kept her because she was so smart, but it still took 10 years for women to regularly be accepted.

**later, at the bar**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: It's 12 O'clock Somewhere_

For some reason, I wasn't expecting a book set in a bar to feature so much drinking, but _later, at the bar_ surprised me. In a good way!

This book features humans who happen to drink a lot and are unapologetic about it. It's a series of stories that peek into their lives, their heartbreaks, flaws, and relationships.

At first I was put off by the alcoholism, but then I appreciated the honesty and lack of judgment in the writing. _Rebecca Barry_ just tells their stories. A quick read that's worth it.

**Norse Mythology**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Listen To Me_

I haven't really gotten into audiobooks because I like seeing words and get distracted when I'm just listening to something. Good thing there are challenges to push me into trying them again right?

One of the reasons I chose _Norse Mythology_ for this challenge is because Neil Gaiman reads it himself. The other reason is that I love Neil Gaiman. (Also PSA: I did not listen to this on Audible, my library has audiobooks to borrow _for free_!)

_Norse Mythology_ is relatively dark compared to my experiences with Greek/Roman mythology. I suspect it's due to the harsher climate of the Nordic countries. While I didn't love the dark stories, I thoroughly enjoyed Gaiman's reading of it. I was engaged and I'm glad to know the stories.

After this, I'm totally down to listen to another audiobook. It's much easier to consume in the subway.
