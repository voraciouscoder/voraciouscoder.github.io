Happy belated Canada Day! I'm immensely grateful to be Canadian ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ I'll have to compile a list of my fave Canadian authors someday. And get to those Louise Penny books I've been meaning to read.

**A River Runs Through It**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Hook 'Em_

I considered a few books for this challenge (like _Trout Fishing in America_) and got partway through _The History of Fly-Fishing in 50 Flies_ but _A River Runs Through It_ won out because it was at my parents' house.

Growing up in a city with a couple big rivers and an outdoorsy vibe gave me opportunities to watch people fly-fishing. Trying to read the history book showed me how long the sport has been around. But this book was perfect for getting at why so many people love it. The descriptions of fishing have stayed in my head more than the sad family story woven into the scenery.

So to me, this is more of a sit back, relax, and enjoy the meditative descriptions book. Almost like fly-fishing itself.
