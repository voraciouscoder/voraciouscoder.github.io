My reading has finally slowed down, unusually because of a vacation. It turns out that travelling with someone leaves me less time to read! On the other hand, I've been able to catch up with some of my oldest bookworm friends (like [Living in the Ink World](https://livingintheinkworld.wordpress.com/) üíù).

**The Year of Less**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: TBRing It_

I don't have an official TBR (to-be-read) list but I saw this book in a few bookshelves earlier this year and had been meaning to read it, so that counts right? No one is keeping track anyway!

I can't remember what got me into personal finance, but I do remember being hooked on two Canadian personal finance reality shows: _Til Debt Do Us Part_ and _Princess_. The host for both of them was the badass finance guru Gail Vaz-Oxlade, and she was in the business of financial makeovers. It was through these shows that I learned about budgets, the power of saving early, and just how awful consumer debt is. They also got me into reading more finance books and blogs, which eventually led me to this one too.

My favourite finance books are the ones that aren't just about investing or saving (the how) but about thinking about what you actually want (the why). It's crazy how much less you need when you decide that you don't need certain things (and I'm definitely speaking from a place of privilege here). _The Year of Less_ fits right into this kind of story. In fact, it was more of a "what I really need" story.

However, this book didn't really speak to me. It was cool to have a Canadian millenial perspective on money things, but because of Gail's shows, the blogs and books that I've read, I didn't find the idea very novel. The book was mostly about the author's struggles with mindless consumption and I didn't identify with a lot of it. I guess I wasn't expecting a story about shopping struggles. I had to admire the author's candor though!

This would be a good book for people who have struggled with debt and spending and perhaps young women who are about to start earning more money, but for me, it wasn't that interesting.

**Fever Dream**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Campfire Story_

I hate horror. I can barely handle thrillers. So you can probably guess that this challenge wasn't my favourite. I ended up choosing this book from a "horror for scaredy-cats" listicle.

This one featured a creepy child and unknown horrors, which are two of the scariest things. Thankfully this book was short and I didn't have to suffer too much to complete it. I actually spent half the time figuring out what was happening in the present and in the past. Definitely a book for those who like atmospheric horror.

Here's to no more horror categories in my reading challenges - there are only so many for scaredy-cats like me.
