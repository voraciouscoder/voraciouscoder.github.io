I was feeling bad that I only read one book this week but it turns out that I read eight books in September so I can't really be disappointed! Busyness comes in waves (_she says as the force of October is hurtling towards her_).

_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book with alliteration in the title_

This book was perfect to fulfill the alliteration category since one of the side characters spoke with an excess of alliteration - I got more than I signed up for! (Kinda like-but not as intense as-the first speech from V in _V for Vendetta_.)

There was _a lot_ jam-packed into this book. It reminded me of _Persepolis_ (for the parts about the Iranian Revolution), _Daring to Drive_ (for the impact on women in rising Islamic conservatism), _Travelling with Pomegranates_ (for the alternating mother/daughter perspectives), and _A Bollywood Affair_ (for the cross-oceanic love story). Phew!

I'm glad there are stories to read about immigration and feeling between cultures, so this is a good one for you if you like that.
