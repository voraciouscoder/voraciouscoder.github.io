Goodbye vacation! It's finally back to work time for me tomorrow but at least I managed to squeeze in two books in the past week. :) Perhaps my commute will mean more reading? (But more likely catching up on emails...)

**Riders of the Purple Shade**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: High Noon_

At first I was dreading to read another western novel (I read _True Grit_ earlier this year for the Read Harder Challenge by Book Riot), but it was fitting that I read this book when I did - during [Stampede](https://www.calgarystampede.com/) season! It put me in the mood to see horses.

This book actually reminded me of _A Study in Scarlet_ for its harsh depiction of Mormons, though it was published 25 years after Sherlock's tale. What I liked the most were the descriptions of the scenery (although maybe the purple sage was mentioned a tad too much), and the two interwoven storylines.

It exceeded my expectations in readability for a book published in 1912! I loved imaging some of the accents of the characters. _The Sisters Brothers_ would still top my list for western recommendations, but this one would come up if someone were asking for more than one. :)

**The Bad Girl**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: You Have a Lovely Accent_

Psh, this was no challenge for me! I've already read several books in translation just this year (_Fever Dream_, _The Black City_, _Midnight Sun_, _Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions_). It must be a habit from watching foreign films with my parents. I'm grateful that so many books are translated into English.

This was my third book by Mario Vargas Llosa, the Nobel Prize-winning author from Peru. I chose the first one (_In Praise of the Stepmother_) right before my flight to South America, on the way to Peru, and finished it before we arrived. It was that good! So I had high expectations of _The Bad Girl_.

I didn't enjoy _The Bad Girl_ as much. I felt mostly felt bad for Ricardo, the main character, and frustrated with the object of his obsession, Otilia. Perhaps that's the feeling Vargas Llosa was going for. The frustration of obsession.

Anyway, this one okay book won't stop me from reading more Mario. There are still so many to try!
