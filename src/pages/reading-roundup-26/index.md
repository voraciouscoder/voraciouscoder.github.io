I completed the Goodreads Ultimate Summer Reading Challenge! It took a lot of planning and research and a few trips to the library, but I did it!

**A Good Indian Wife**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Let's Get It On_
I really disliked the main guy in this book, the fancy doctor with his fancy red Porsche. It took him the whole book to change, and by the end I wasn't convinced. Not your typical romance for sure!

Nevertheless, it was fun to read about another culture, especially centered around culture clash and immigration. It reminded me of Bend It Like Beckham, one of my favourite movies about being caught between two cultures.

Which reminds me now that I have yet to see Crazy Rich Asians!!! I've heard such good things about it. Particularly about Awkwafina, who I've loved for years <3 I'm thankful for more Asian representation in the media :D

**lobster is the best medicine**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book with an animal in the title_

I've been a fan of Liz Climo for a while! It was fun to read a whole collection of her comics. Plus there's just something extra nice about reading comics in print.

Her use of animals makes the old biology student in me happy :D (Low-key reminds me of Telus commercials too hehe). It's been a while since I read a bio book, maybe I should find another to read...
