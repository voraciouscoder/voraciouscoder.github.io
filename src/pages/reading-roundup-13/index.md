Apparently travelling with friends means ice cream, kayaking, board games but no reading time. Whatever! I got quality over quantity this week :sparkling_heart:

[**The Outlander**](http://www.dianagabaldon.com/books/outlander-series/)  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book about time travel_

OMG. I _loved_ this book. It had a strong woman protagonist, sexy accents, sexy scenes, details galore, ...
and more things that I can't name because I'm so excited about the book!!!
I read this beautiful brick in two days! (I didn't really know I was signing up for 600+ pages since I read the ebook version.)
It's my first adult time-travelling book (I was going to say first overall, but then I remembered
[Molly Moon](https://www.mollymoonsworld.com/the-books/molly-moon-books/)) and I have to say I was skeptical that I would like it.
But ohhhh yes, I was proven wrong, very wrong. Reading until 4am to finish it wrong. Sometimes it's unhealthy to be proven wrong. :confused:

It's funny because while thinking about what I would write for this post, I realized how similiar it is to another one of my favourites: _Ransom My Heart_ by Meg Cabot.
I wonder how much of it was inspired by Outlander. Or maybe this is how most romances of this type are written.
Again, I thank my reading challenges for helping me try new reads!

Of course, when I started raving about it to my fellow bookworms, they'd already read it (and the rest of the series!) and loved it. So you probably have as well.
But I don't care that I'm late, I'm glad I discovered it!
And apparently the TV adaptation is great too (not that I'm going to watch it).
So if you haven't already, go forth and experience it!

[**The Silver Linings Playbook**](http://matthewquickwriter.com/novels/the-silver-linings-playbook/)  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book about mental health_

Since Iâ€™m extremely picky about which movies I watch, I often miss out on pop culture things. I can often fix that by reading the book
(which is usually the original anyway).
I did that with _Hidden Figures_ last year, and I'll probably skip seeing _Crazy, Rich Asians_ since I already read and loved the book.
_The Silver Linings Playbook_ is the first book that's made me want to see the movie.

This novel is written from the first-person perspective of a person who has a mental illness.
I found this point-of-view to be refreshing, since you could see the struggle from the inside.
There were moments that made me laugh, but also many that broke my heart.
What I want to see is how they portrayed things from the outside in the movie (or did they?).
So while I do that, you can go and read that book :)
