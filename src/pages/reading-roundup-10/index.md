This week’s verdict: travel is excellent for my reading progress! It was fun to be in a cold country, yet reading about sweating in the hot, Sicilian sun.

**Open House**  
_Read Harder Challenge: An Oprah Book Club selection_

A lot of the Oprah Book Club selections looked like intensely emotional reads, and this one wasn’t an exception. I think I was able to stomach it because I’ve never gone through a divorce, but oh, how I felt the hurt in this one! But also the growth! The heart-wrenching, cringey beginning made the character development way more satisfying. It was definitely an inner conflict kind of book, the grown-up version to my favourite kinds of books as a teenager. This is the best part about reading - the lives you get to live without really living them (or maybe the worst part!?).

**Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions**  
_Read Harder Challenge: A book with a female protagonist over the age of 60_

I went on a Miss Marple-esque (older women detectives) streak! I read a Miss Marple short, then the first Aunty Lee, and then this lovely tale. It’s funny that I ended up reading this story right after Aunty Lee’s Delights because there are many similarities - the age of the investigators, the digressions on food, and the hot, humid settings (Singapore and Sicily - another similarity!). While I enjoyed both books, this one satisfied my mystery critic much better. It all came full circle! :D

This book makes me want to visit Sicily, go mushroom-picking, listen to elders argue about food, sit on the beach, drink great wine, and be passionate in general. That’s what it inspired in me, which is funny, because usually mysteries are all about the characters. And yes, the characters in the book are great! That’s why I mentioned listening to arguments and being passionate. But the descriptions of Italy were mouth-watering. Lit, as the cool people would say? So go read this book unless you want to avoid wanting to go to Italy. :)

(P.S. This one was originally my choice for “A book of genre fiction in translation”, but it was much easier to find more genre fiction in translation than books with female protagonists over the age of 60 :()

**Aunty Lee’s Delights**  
_Read Harder Challenge: A mystery by a person of color or LGBTQ+ author_

If I’m to be honest here, I might have chosen this novel because I had such a fun time reading a Singaporean series (_Crazy, Rich Asians_) last year. What convinced me even more was that it was endorsed by Louise Penny, the popular Canadian mystery author (who I have yet to read, please forgive me). I found out in the notes at the end of the book that Ovidia Yu actually was inspired to write the novel because of Louise Penny! Ahh, the connections!

This book was an enjoyable read. I loved the array of characters: unlikely investigator and chef Aunty Lee, her ever-helpful, Watson-like Filipina maid, the social-climbing daughter-in-law that reminded me of _Crazy, Rich Asians_ series, and so many more. I loved that Aunty Lee’s superpower is her cooking, and that food elements are weaved throughout the whole book. It’s even mentioned that her notes are reminiscent of a recipe :)

It was a treat to read a mystery featuring people of colour. I guess I’ve been reading a lot of old-school mysteries set in Britain or Europe. Thank you Read Harder Challenge for making me discover other delights!

I wasn’t a huge fan of how the investigation finished. It felt like many of the details came out at the end, and I find that the most satisfying mysteries are those that tie up clues from the beginning. Or maybe my expectations are at peak Agatha Christie level ;) Even so, I had fun reading this story, and I look forward to reading the rest of the series!

(P.S. I originally set out to read _The Summer We Got Free_ by Mia McKenzie since it’s written by a badass PoC and LGBTQ+ but it was unavailable at the three library systems I have access to!)

**True Grit**  
_Read Harder Challenge: A western_

I had to choose this book when I realized that main character is a young woman seeking to avenge her father. How many westerns feature that!? I wouldn’t actually know because I don’t read or watch a lot of westerns. I do know that revenge, outlaws, gold, and horses are common threads though, and this book has ‘em all!

While it was fun to have a woman lead, I did enjoy _The Sisters Brothers_ more than this book. I remember laughing more. And I hated the description of the amputation… Maybe I shouldn’t watch the movie then. A version of _The Sisters Brothers_ is due to come out this year though! So I’d say if you wanna dip your toes into a western, this ain’t bad but I liked _The Sisters Brothers_ better.

**July’s People**  
_Read Harder Challenge: A book set in or about one of the five BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, or South Africa)_

I chose this book because it’s by Nadine Gordimer, a South African winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. I love crossing off two challenge requirements with one book! It also makes choosing books easier <3 I actually chose _No Time Like the Present_ first, which is also by Gordimer, but I found it the writing style hard to follow. Maybe if I’d read it during my travels I might have tried harder to get through it ;)

This novel was one vision Gordimer had of the end of apartheid in South Africa, about a decade before it happened, where a civil war caused a white family to flee into hiding in their black employee’s village. I’m not familiar with a lot of this part of history, so I ended up reading more on South Africa to give myself more context for the read. Yay for books that expand our horizons!

The book only told the the story of one family, but this was so powerful, because you can feel the growing helplessness of the parents. I found it quite accurate that the kids in the family easily adjusted, picking up the customs, the language, and of course, playmates. While I can’t say that I enjoyed reading this book since the topics were quite heavy, but I’m glad I did because it allowed me to learn more about another corner of our planet.

**The Old Chief Mshlanga**  
_Read Harder Challenge: A book of colonial or postcolonial literature_

I chose this little story to introduce myself to Doris Lessing, another Nobel Prize-winning woman, and I wasn’t disappointed. In a small amount of text she was able to dive into colonial tensions without naming specific places. I also got another coming-of-age story, which I loved in this case, because the girl’s realization of injustice feels more emotional. I think I’ll have to pick up more Doris Lessing!
