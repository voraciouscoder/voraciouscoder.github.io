This week I'm grateful for my reading habit. Despite being extra busy this week, I managed to finish a few books! The trick is to _always have a book_ (and have a bae that joins you in reading books before bed <3).

**Captain Pantoja and the Special Service**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Read the World_

I think I really like epistolary novels! This one snuck (sneaked?) into my reading list without me choosing it for its letters.

The best parts of this book were the letters of the title character to his military superiors detailing the needs of his _special_ service in the most clinical manner.

There were some sections that were so hard to read because they switched contexts (characters and location) by the paragraph. The only indications were the names of the characters. I think a little bit of formatting could have helped readability without losing the desired weaving of scenes.

Despite this, I laughed (out loud) so much reading this book (and my bae can attest to this). It may not have been the top Mario Vargas Llosa book, but I enjoyed it immensely.

**In Praise of the Stepmother**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Memories_

I didn't buy any books on my vacations this year so I decided to do a re-read for this challenge. _In Praise of the Stepmother_ was one of the books I bought on the eve of my backpacking trip to Peru.

This is the book that introduced me to Mario Vargas Llosa and erotic _literature_. It's the one I finished on the plane there! And now Vargas Llosa is one of my faves.

As a re-read I found myself appreciating the writing more and wondering how it is to read it in Spanish. I rediscovered the word _scabrous_. What a salacious, scabrous story. :p

**The Obstacle Is The Way**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Lucky to Have You_

This is one of the books I have access to through the collection of books recommended by execs at my job. I'm lucky to have a culture of reading at work, and free books!

However, _The Obstacle Is The Way_ was not the most impactful read for me. I think it's meant to be an intro or a modern take on Stoicism but even the author says it's best to read the original texts.

I could see this book inspiring some people but to be honest, I'm tired of reading about (white) men's success stories. It dominates our culture and you'll hear about them anyway.

I felt a lot more motivated by the stories of the women I read in _Rad Women Worldwide_. They _definitely_ faced obstacles that helped them succeed.

**Flaming Iguanas**.  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Time of Our Lives_

It takes me so long to read my own books. I said that I'd started this one on June 3rd but really, I only got into it August 23rd. There's no deadline so there's no sense of urgency!

Anyway, I'm glad to have bought and read this book. It reads like a stream of consciousness story while following Tomato (the main character) through America.

I loved how unapologetic it was, in its feminism, sexuality, and unstructured form. The drawings and art were a treat. Now I want to go on my own road trip adventure!
