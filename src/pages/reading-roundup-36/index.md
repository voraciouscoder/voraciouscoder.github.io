The upside of reading one book a week is I only have to write one book reaction ;) It's been quite a sci-fi/fantasy fall, and this week was no exception!

**The Book of Phoenix**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A cyberpunk book_

I start to see patterns in Nndei Okorafor's writing. The shea butter in this book is like otjize in _Binti_. There's embedded communication between beings and travel between America and Africa. She's not afraid to kill characters ðŸ’”

This book gave me major Princess Mononoke vibes, in the form of the earth taking away what it had been given and disabused. Now I'm in need of a feel-good book because this one felt too real. A cli-fi (climate fiction) kind of thing.

Global warming is inevitable, rich white men rule the world, rape of girls and women continues... What is just one woman to do? Not get down I suppose. Give back, reduce consumption, take care, love brightly. Small things ðŸ¦‹
