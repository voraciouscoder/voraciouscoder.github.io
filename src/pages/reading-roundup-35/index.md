It's birthday season (aka 9 months after February) and that means celebrating! Less time for reading but good times with friends - and discovering new dessert places, miam miam!

**Vicious**
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book about a villain or antihero_

I finally a understand the hype around this book! I couldn't read it slowly. Once I got past being annoyed at the flashbacks, I flew through the pages.

It's definitely not a book to start before bed, nor one for lighthearted feels. More like for villains, revenge, and shades of moral gray, which is probably more familiar to y'all who consume more superhero sagas than me.

I wouldn't have read this without the challenge prompt, so once again, yay for reading challenges that break me out of my reading comfort zone. Though now I feel like I've earned a feel-good story ♥️
