It feels like September bustle has hit me early this year! Course prep, website updates, signing up to the next session of improv classes... There's a lot to do and I'm excited to settle into a less harried routine and be able to read in peace.

**Beauty Queens**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Stranded_

I was so skeptical of this book by its cover, and my association of Libba Bray with period fiction. I'm so glad I stuck with it because it was a riot to read! I laughed and giggled and _had_ to share parts with fellow readers throughout the book.

I was glad that it followed a diversity of girls and tackled issues like race and beauty culture and sexuality. The first half read a lot easier than the end (there were a lot of loose ends to tie up), but I was so invested in the characters, I wanted to know what happened in the end.

The "commercial breaks" as parodies of beauty ads were the best! So hilarious! I would watch subscribe to a YouTube channel of those :D
