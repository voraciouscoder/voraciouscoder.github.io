More sci-fi! And I'm not even done for the year since _Ready Player One_ is next on my TBR. After that I'll need some cozy mysteries to be ready to face new worlds again!

**The Quantum Thief**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book set on another planet_

I wanted to give up on this book a couple of times. I even tried reading another book set away from Earth but I gave up on that one because it was too cheesy for me. In the end, I stuck with this Martian tale.

This book gave me a taste of "hard SF", or hard science fiction, which I think should be hardcore science fiction because the world is hard to understand. I guess this is what you get for reading a book by an author with a PhD in string theory.

Nevertheless, the usual human elements of greed, vengence, and loyalty are there, so I enjoyed this book. My favourite character had to be the flirty spaceship Perhonen, and I enjoyed that there were badass woman characters <3

Now that I have a bit of a grasp of the world, I think I'll give Rajaniemi's other books a try, but after a bit of time to give my brain a rest.
