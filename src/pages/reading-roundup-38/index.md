I'm done!!! I've completed the POPSUGAR Reading Challenge, my third reading challenge of the year ðŸ™ŒðŸŽ‰ Time to start planning for the new year âœ¨(and maybe sneak in some guilty pleasure reading)

**Ready Player One**

This book was meh for me. It felt like a pop culture dude book, which is great for that target audience. Just like cheesy chick lit is great for me (sometimes! A girl can only read so much cheesiness).

I got through it in two days though, so it was pretty engaging and the stuff I did get was nice (yay for text adventures!). I'm not super pleased with the token diverse person but it underlined how shitty the future in this book is, where it still sucks to be gay or black or a woman or all three!

Oh, and I was getting major Manic Pixie Dream Girl vibes from the portrayal of the main girl character ðŸ™„ C'mon.

Anyway, at least I'm caught up with this piece of pop culture! One protip: if you haven't read this yet, _don't_ read a hard SF book before it. You'll only questionor be more skeptical of the tech in this one.
