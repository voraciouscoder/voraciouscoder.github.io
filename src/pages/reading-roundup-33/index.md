I read ZERO books last week. That's a first for this half of the year! The wave of busyness crashed over me and the books were let go. Good thing I'm ahead of schedule for my challenge!

**Haroun and the Sea of Stories**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book mentioned in another book_

This challenge again! I should be keeping a running list of them because it's _not_ the easiest to source, and I like to pick from books that I've read.

I pulled this story from _The Borrowers_, which is about a librarian, so it had many mentions. I'd already read many of them, but this book was perfect because I haven't read any Salman Rushie yet.

_Haroun_ is one of those books that's written for kids but still fun as an adult. I was most reminded of _The Phantom Tollbooth_ because of its personification of books and other storytelling devices.

I'm also reminded of _The Palace of Illusions_ by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni for the elements of Indian culture. My next choice of mythologies will have to be from farther east.

**The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book with an ugly cover_

Another challenge that makes me judge books by their covers :( I chose this cover because the are two pictures on it, one of them has text you're supposed to read all over it, I don't understand why there's gradient, and the quote at the top is distracting. Enough reasons?

This book was another one suggested by execs at work. To be honest, I think I find more inspiration in everyday people around me than in child prodigies or world champions. People overcome adversity in so many ways and I'm more interested in the everyday experience.

Not everyone is single-mindedly aiming for world championships, but this was a jaunt into the mind of someone who did.
