Week 9 features only one book, a much denser non-fiction story. It often takes me longer to read non-fiction, and this one was no exception.

**The Soul of a New Machine**

_Read Harder Challenge: An assigned book you never finished_

This book was assigned for a bonus mark on the final exam in my computer systems class. I’d say that the five core courses I was taking that semester (my first in Computer Science) got in the way of reading it. I don’t think I would have appreciated it as much back then! My mom would say it’s because I’ve gotten nerdier.

This book was an adventure into the development of a new computer. It made me appreciate how far we’ve come in technology, and glad that working in computers doesn’t require the crazy dedication described in the book (though there are definitely people in tech who still work that much!). I loved finding out about Betty Shanahan, the one woman on the team, the references to Adventure, an early text adventure game (if you’ve never tried one, please do!!!), and clever analogies by Terry Pratchett. Basically, it pleased the nerd in me (the computer one, not the bio one).

If you’re worried that it’s too nerdy for you though, remember that it won a Pulitzer Prize, and that’s for a good reason: you’re kept on the edge of your seat, and the technical details are explained in an approachable way. It got me inspired for my own teaching - earlier this year, I had to explain some of the concepts mentioned in the book to my students. I guess now I know why it was assigned ;)
