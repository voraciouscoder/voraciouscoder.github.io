Keeping up the pace this week despite being distracted by re-reading a couple of my cheesy old YA favourites from high school (_Just Listen_ and _This Lullaby_ by Sarah Dessen)!

**Daughter of the Pirate King** & **Daughter of the Siren Queen**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: Set at sea_
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Ocean Blue_

This pair of YA books were a delightful jaunt into the world of pirates and sirens. The might have been my favourites if I'd read them in high school, but alas, they were a bit repetitive and shallow for me now. As a recommendation for YA readers for strong women and adventure, definitely. Maybe even an easy beach read.

**The Joy Luck Club**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: School's Out for Summer_

The last time I read this book was about ten years ago. I'd like to find the essay I wrote about it. The power of re-reading is in the reflection of how you've changed, and I'm sure I'd gain some insight by reading my old opinions. (I wonder what kinds of insight I'll have reading back on this blog!?)

The style of multiple viewpoints over time seems like a theme in the Asian women authors I've read (_That Summer in Provincetown_, _Ru_). I feel like I'm getting a "2-for-1" kind of deal in terms of perspective. In _The Joy Luck Club_, it's eight stories woven together beautifully. It definitely deserves more than one read because you probably missed how some of the stories were connected.

**The Children of Men**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: It's the End of the World_

In general, apocalyptic novels aren't my favourite. So for this challenge I took the chance to read the book that inspired a movie I enjoyed of the same name. It turns out that the movie was quite different that the book (but that's not really a surprise, is it?). Many of the elements from the book are in the movie, but with different characters.

I'm glad I read a woman author for this challenge. It was fascinating perspective on an infertile human race. The parts that described dolls as desperate substitutes for real babies felt so creepy and heartbreaking. I wouldn't read it again, but I might recommend it and maybe try to read more PD James?

**The Sleeper and the Spindle**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: My, What Big Teeth You Have_

Sleeping Beauty was never my favourite princess or story, so I was _so_ happy with this retelling. Neil Gaiman hasn't disappointed me yet. Neither has Chris Riddell, the illustrator. This book is so short you should just go read it.

**Cadillac Cathedral**  
_Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge: Into the Great Wide Open_

Perhaps this book wasn't exactly set in the wilderness but there were rebellious acts in the relative wilderness of rural BC. It felt true to the Tom Petty song. I enjoyed this departure from a big city setting! Also it featured characters in retirement, and satisfyingly active ones. The perfect contrasting perspectiv eafter reading too much YA this week.

This book reminded how much I love friend visits on ordinary days when you or they are in the midst of chores. That's when you know you're good friends. Why wait for an "event" to hang out? So it pleased me to read the same sentiments in _Cadillac Cathedral_. The other fun part for me were the mentions of Finnish culture and names which I was able to share with dear Finnish friend (and fellow bookworm). We're already planning a _seisova pöytä_ (a kind of food spread/buffet).
