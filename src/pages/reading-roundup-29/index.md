Fall is here! Which I wish it meant cozying up to books and hot tea, but really means that teaching duties are picking up, volunteer meetings have been organized, and there are so many shows to go to. I don't really live in an introverted city, hehe.

**Vagina Monologues**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book from a celebrity book club_

It took me a few chapters in this book to make me remember that I'd already read it before, oops! I must have read it too fast last time. I'm glad I have Goodreads to help me keep track now.

This book made me want to go see a Vagina Monologues show. I'm sure there would be many kindred spirits :) It's just not the same to imagine the performance from written words.

I'm glad to live where I do, where in lieu of the usual penis graffiti on political posters, it's been vaginas. It's refreshing. ({*})

**Void Moon**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book about a heist_

Wow! This book made me miss my metro stop twice in one morning. Soooooo engrossing, like a heist book should be, right?

After seeing Ocean's 8 in theatres this summer, (which is a big deal for me, I almost never go!) I had to pick a heist book that featured a woman and _Void Moon_ did not disappoint.

Despite including descriptions of tech and being almost 20 years old, the book aged well. Believable enough for me, though maybe that says more about what I know of thieving technology.

I'm sad there are no more books featuring Cassie Black, but maybe I'll have to try another one of Connelly's books.
