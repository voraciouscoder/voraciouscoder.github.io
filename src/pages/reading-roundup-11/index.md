I missed writing book reactions! Also I bumped into [Heather O'Neill](https://twitter.com/lethal_heroine) and I felt inspired to write more.
So here I am, back to writing about my week's reads.

[**The Carnival at Bray**](http://jessieannfoley.com/?page_id=47)  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book set in the decade you were born_

This was a fun read! It probably would have been one of my favourites if it had been released when I was in high school.
I'm a sucker for first love stories. Also I've been meaning to plan a trip to Ireland, and this book only fuels this wish even more.
The only question I'm left with now is how to pronounce Eoin. Oh Irish names <3

_Update: Apparently Eoin is like Owen :heart_eyes:_

[**Decisive: How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work**](http://heathbrothers.com/books/decisive/)  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book by two authors_

This book was highly touted at work (and there were free copies to take), so I gave it a read.
There were plenty of actionable ideas in it, and quite applicable given that we all have thousands of decisions to make every day.
As someone who can get overwhelmed with the packed nature of non-fiction, I appreciated the chapter summaries.
Not the most enjoyable read of the week, but definitely useful and recommendable!

[**Just My Type: A Book About Fonts**](http://www.simongarfield.com/pages/books/just_my_type.htm)  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A microhistory_

If I thought I was picky about fonts before... it's much worse now. I loved this mish-mash of stories about type.
It put real humans behind the letters everyone sees! I was reminded of researching the mathematicians behind different formulas.
(Or maybe of a different microhistory I've read.) This book introduced me to the _world_ of type. It's huge!
Thankfully we're in the age of the Internet where I can simply search them online, not laboriously in doorstopper book.
I learned about the hate for Comic Sans and Arial, but also the love for Helvetica, and just how old some types are.
It even helped me choose the fonts for this new site (I ditched one because of its long commas).
So if you want to have a taste of the passion behind the shapes of letters, please read this book :)
