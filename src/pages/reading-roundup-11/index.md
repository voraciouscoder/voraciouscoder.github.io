I’m done the 2018 Read Harder Challenge! It took me 71 days, so a book almost every three days.
That means I finished two months earlier than last year, and I am free to go on to the next challenge!

**The Lover**  
_Read Harder Challenge: A book of genre fiction in translation (romance)_

This book reminded me of _That Summer in Provincetown_
(which is fitting, because that was the first read of the Read Harder Challenge, and this is my last read of it!!!)
in the vignette-style, the re-telling of the same events in different ways, and the setting in Southeast Asia.
I thought this one was less successful though. Perhaps because this one is fancier (it won the _Prix Goncourt_).
Or maybe because it went over my head? It could just be literature that I am unequipped to examine. The story is sad but not surprising.
I completely understand why the content was controversial. Maybe that’s why people read it. Y’all can find out for yourselves. :)
