The other day I saw a canvas bag with the slogan: READ MORE WOMEN. I want it because I've done so this year and discovered so much. I want others to do the same!

**Circe**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book published in 2018_

A banquet of Greek mythology woven around the goddess Circe, this book tackles some of the toughest struggles of being a woman and human, from motherhood to rape to mortality. I think this starts a personal trend of _listening_ to mythology books.

I enjoyed this book, though it was a little too long for me. It was fun to see gods from a different, less fun-loving perspective. I learned of a few other myths I'd never heard of before, despite a period of voraciously reading Greek myths in Grade 6. [SPOILER: Did anyone else get the _Tuck Everlasting_ feels at the end?]

I felt a dark vibe from this story similar to _Norse Mythology_, but I wasn't expecting it from Greek mythology! Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more had I not been reading the even heavier _Bad Feminist_ concurrently. One can only absorb so much weight at a time <\/3

So now I'm off to go read something funny!

**The Lover's Dictionary**  
_Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book you borrowed or was given to you as a gift_

I found my lighter read in this precious book <3 It features a word per page with a description that captures a slice of love - happy or otherwise.

The descriptions range from one sentence to a full paragraph - a testament to how much one word can inspire. I enjoyed this so much because of its parallels to improv. Often it's just one word that sparks a _whole_ scene!

I'm glad I picked this up on a whim - I've been sticking religiously to books that fit my reading challenges (though this one fit a challenge anyway).

**Daring to Drive**  

This is the third piece of literature/art I've experienced from Saudi Arabia. The first was the movie _Wadjda_, the first movie filmed entirely in Saudi (and directed by a woman!) which I recommend wholeheartedly. The other was _Girls of Riyadh_, by Rajaa al-Sanea, which gave another insider peek into Saudi culture.

I found all of these pieces difficult to read/watch (but also fascinating) because of all the obstacles Saudi women face in their day-to-day lives, and the extreme inequality between genders. This was especially true for _Daring to Drive_.

Women driving is no big deal right? That's until you understand the context, which is what most of this book was. It was a dive into the culture that forbids women in so many ways.

One of the hardest chapters for me was the one on female circumcision (or more accurately, genital mutilation). It comes early in the book, and it surprised me because I still thought this book was about driving. No details are spared.

I loved that al-Sharif studied Computer Science like me! It was fun to read the details she shared about her work. She's a CS role model I'd love to share to all my fellow women in tech. 

All-in-all reading this book made me feel immensely grateful for where I was born and now live. <3
